// returns timestamp values verbatim so its column `mode` can handle them.
// That override wins over the global registry. Timestamps are normalised to
// ISO in `mappers.ts` instead; see the note there.

// Lazy singleton: the pool / drizzle instance are constructed on first
// access, not at module import. Lets test runners and tooling import
// `@brandfactory/db` (e.g. for the `User` row type) without DATABASE_URL
// being set. Real query helpers still throw if no connection string is
// configured by the time they run.
